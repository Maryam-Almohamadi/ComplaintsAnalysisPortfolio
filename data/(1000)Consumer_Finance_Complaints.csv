11/29/2017,Debt collection,Federal student loan debt,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was reviewing my federal student loans, which are held by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I noticed that my interest rates had all increased - for instance, for my Direct Grad PLUS loan, my interest rates of 6.96 % had changed to 7.2 %. For my FFEL unsubsidized loan the interest rate had increased from 6.55 % to 6.96 % For my FFEL subsidized loan the interest rate increased from 5.35 to 5.59 %. The same can be said of my Direct loans, of which there are 10 tranches ( but I would be happy to outline the interest rates  and increases if needed ). 

On the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my loan provider Great Lakes. I expressed my concern to the representative that my interest rates had increased at some point before XX/XX/XXXX and the last time I had checked my account, at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. The representative insisted that my loans were at a fixed-rate interest rate. I agreed, and said that the interest rates had increased regardless. She insisted this was not correct, but agreed to email me a copy of my original MPNs to indicate that the rates had not changed. 

After a day I had not received my MPNs from the loan provider. I found the MPNs myself through studentloans.gov and confirmed that the interest rates were what I had them documented as, instead of what Great Lakes was claiming them to be. I was going to call Great Lakes again, but I noticed online that the rates had been changed back to what they originally were supposed to be. 

I feel that Great Lakes is therefore exercising these practices with other people, who may not notice that their interest rates have increased. I 'm also fearful that they will try to increase the rates again, even though the loans are fixed-rate loans.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,GREAT LAKES,DC,200XX,,Consent provided,Web,11/29/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2741598

1/30/2018,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Fraudulent loan,"Purchased a car from a dealer. Dealer did not pay the floor plan company for the car which made it difficult to get a tag for the car. Before the paper tag expired, the dealership closed down. While speaking with the finance company about the issue with the tag, I contacted the finance company to inquire about having to make payments on the car that I could not drive due to no legal tag. During this conversation, I asked the Director of the company ( XXXX XXXX ) if they could void the contract since there seemed to be some fraudulent activity going on. He told me that was not possible. After 5 months of not being able to drive the car due to no tag, the DMV was finally able to provide me with a tag. The 5 months that the car was parked, my wife & I still made our payments faithfully & on time. XX/XX/2018 we began the process to purchase a home & hired a certified credit consultant. Once our credit was pulled & the car showed up on the credit, our credit consultant asked to see the contract for the car. Due to the dealership advising us that the finance company would send the paperwork ( contract )  in the mail once they received the package & we never received it, we made contact with the finance company to request a copy of the contract. Once receipt of the contract, I noticed there was information that was not true & information that I did not have knowledge of. There was indications that I traded a car for this car ( but I did not ). As well as indication that the finance company of my first car would be paid off ( but it was not ). The down payment amount was not correct. The contract showed a down payment of {$1000.00} when in fact we put {$1200.00} down. There was nothing in the contract about GAP insurance but the dealer told us that part of the down payment would be used to purchase GAP coverage. After looking over the contract we then reached out to the finance company again to inform them of our findings. The rep we spoke with ( XXXX XXXX ) stated that he needed to pass the information along to someone above him and he would have someone from the finance or funding department to contact us. We did not hear from them on the day he promised so we initiated contacted again. At this time we were placed on hold & were told the department we needed to speak with was on another call & would be with us shortly. After holding for 5 mins, XXXX came to the line asking if anyone had contacted us and once told no he stated he would go to the person that was to contact us & make them aware that we were waiting to hear from them. After speaking with XXXX, we then decided to email him. This email informed the company that they seemed unsure about how to handle such a issue therefore, we thought it may help if we told them what we wanted to happen due to this fraudulent contract. We let it be known that we wanted out of the contract with no negative remarks on our credit, we wanted all payments made returned and we wanted them to retrieve their car. 2 hours later we received a email from XXXX XXXX with her direct phone # and asking that I contact her at our convenience. Shortly after receiving the email I called XXXX with my wife there with me and listening to the entire cal. XXXX asked that we start from the beginning with the issue of the loan. I told her about the issue with not having a tag and not being able to drive the car for the first 5 months. She was informed that I tried to see if the dealer had reopened before contacting them. I confirmed there was no car traded in, I informed her the down payment amount on the contract was incorrect and she was also informed that the car that the dealer said was traded is not a car that we own. She asked if the dealer told us to lie to them during the welcome call about the down payment amount and we told her no. We explained that the dealer advised us that the down payment amount that would be stated in the welcome call was because of the way the dealer was going to split the down payment up among the GAP coverage and warranty. XXXX stated 3-4 different times during the call that the contract was definitely fraud. Her exact words each time was "" oh, yes maam, this is definitely fraud on their end ''. The call ended by XXXX saying she needed to speak with her manager, let them know what we wanted and she promised to get back with us the nest day. As XXXX did contact me back the next day, she then changed from what she said the previous day and said there was no fraud. When asked why she was no changing what she said from the previous call, she denied ever saying that she admitted the contract was fraudulent and then asked why I kept bringing up yesterdays conversation. Once I realized she seemed to be doing just as dirty as the dealership, I then let her know that the company could keep the money that had been paid on the car but I wanted out of the contract because doing business with their company has been nothing but a headache. We ended the call by XXXX saying she would pass the information of me wanting out of the contract with no negative remarks on my credit even if there was no refund of payments to her manager and "" if he would like '', he would contact me. 
XXXX was representing the finance company and stated herself the contract was fraudulent but then after she spoke with other people in the company, she denied ever saying that. Then stated that I was asked about having another car during a welcome call but no we were not.",,"Coastal Credit, LLC",SC,293XX,,Consent provided,Web,1/30/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2798234

Additionally, XXXX and Experian report this account as closed in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. The lender ( XXXX XXXX ) is attempting to ILLEGALLY re-age a closed, charged off account. According to the FCRA, the beginning, first date of delinquency can not be changed once an account is charged off. Once a charged off account reaches 7 years, then the credit bureaus must purge the account from your credit history. XXXX XXXX has ILLEGALLY re-opened the account in an attempt to reset the 7 year clock. It is illegal for a creditor to change the purge from date on a negative account by reopening the account so that it remains on the consumer credit report. 

In light of the lack ethical practices on behalf of XXXX XXXX, incorrect payment history, incorrect account status, I am requesting that this account is REMOVED from my credit reports immediately. I have disputed this account several times and both XXXX and Experian have failed to adequately investigate my dispute after verifying these accounts which I know are inaccurate.

They were surprised on why Navient reported a deliquesce on my student loan account, for it being 4 months past due. They were surprised because in XXXX of 2017, when applying for my mortgage, they pulled my credit and I was, at that time, listed as "" in good standing '' with Navient. My first question is how do you go from being in good standing to being delinquent for 4 months in two months! The math does n't add up, there has to be a mistake. <P/>After receiving the call on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2017 at XXXX, I quickly called Navient to settle the issue. I paid the past due payments, bringing my account to paid in full. They took the money out of my account on Tuesday as well. I called everyday since Tuesday, ( Wednesday at XXXX XXXX, Thursday at XXXX and at XXXX XXXX ) and finally on Wednesday night they processed the payment, even though they had already charged my account. I have asked everyday for them to send a notice to the Credit Bureau stating that my account was now paid in full, is current, and is in good standing, so that my credit score could get back to it 's previous score. As of right now, the response that I keep on getting from their customer service reps is that they can not send a notice until the end of the month.

Two months back I have opted for new home owner insurance policy, informed bank about it and I made couple of call to inform them about my new insurance premium payment. Insurance agent sent them invoice but bank never paid them. I have received a cancellation notice from insurance company, I called bank on XXXX XXXX 2017 to inquire about the payment and they admitted they never paid it ( my online account says they paid premium but it was not the case ) but there a confusion from their side ( not sure what it is ). When I asked them did they get cancellation notice from insurance company, they said yes as they got it on XXXX XXXX 2017 then why did n't they act immediately? why are they waiting until I call and let them know about missing payment? I call them on XXXX XXXX, they initiated payment on XXXX XXXX ( online account says disbursed on XXXX XXXX - false details ). Today is the last day insurance company would cancel my policy if they do n't receive payment, I called bank, CSR says we need allow 7 days to deliver the check, and CSR assumes it will be delivered and insurance would reinstate the policy, who is responsible if payment is not made by end of today? what if damage happens over the weekend? Bank put me corner and I was in scary mode now, surprisingly second time happening this to me like this as Title company never paid premium amount to insurance for which I lived in home for 7 months without home insurance and no one took responsibility about it. Always CSR speaks something not sure it is recorded they assume a lot but they do n't take responsibility, they give robot type answers, not allowed me to speak to their manager when needed. But CSR gave random answers, different CSR 's give different answers.

4/4/2017,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"I feel as though I have been a victim of predatory lending by navient. I was steered into a tuition answer loan twice by my school and ot was not clear to me at that time that this loan was in a niche catagory meaning that it was not technically a student loan nor was it technically private. Meaning that it could not be eligible for income based repayment because it 's "" private '' nor can it be claimed under bankruptcy because it is a "" student loan. '' I was on XXXX at the time that I got these loans and having trouble making ends meet. I feel that I was pushed into it by my college, which is now defunct. I had a XXXX and to this day I continue to struggle being that I 'm not at a high paying job and I remain on state based health insurance ( XXXX and XXXX, which I pay for now ) in order to keep my XXXX going with very expensive XXXX. I have limited options in repayment and the amount due almost equals XXXX of my bi weekly paychecks leaving me little to live on. I was steered by navient into a "" lower interest rate '' plan but had no idea that doing so would not help me pay any principal at all. Also even though my payments are on time being in this low interest plan payment has limited my options and ability to have my consigned released. I was not educated as to the stipulations of these loans and it has literally ruined my life. I continue to depend on others and my family because this has tarnished my credit history. I feel as though i would have made a better choice as to not applying for these loans had I known the turmoil I 'd go through in my life due to their damage. I think they take advantage of navet of students who are trying to make ends meet while in college and not aware of the actual terms until it 's time to repay and you are out of options. Not all of us graduate from college and land a high paying position and in order to pay these back that 's what would need to happen. And especially with these sneaky loans disguised as student loans which are not really private otherwise I 'd have gone bankrupt to help my situation. I need help and I 've been hearing of a lot of lawsuits regarding this company and others going through the same or similar circumstances.

I submitted the required online application XX/XX/XXXX. A letter dated XX/XX/XXXX indicated I was denied for IBR because it was not time to recalculate my payment and they would notify me when it is time to submit my annual recertification documentation.

I called the day I received the letter 2/8/17 and spoke with XXXX id no. XXXX.XXXX had to do research and he found out that there was conflicting information in the system. One part was saying it is time to re-certify because you have to do so every 12 months by law, however, because whoever processed the IBR plan made it for a 16 mth period and not a 12 mth period another part of the system indicated it was n't time to reapply because I still had 4mth to go on the existing payment plan. He indicated to be safe just resubmit my IBR application and everything should be taken care of. I resubmitted the same day XX/XX/XXXX.A letter dated XX/XX/XXXX indicated that I was approved for IBR and my new payment would be {$490.00} starting XX/XX/XXXX. Another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX was received that says that they approved an administrative forbearance on my loans and that they would send any notification of any interest that accrues and if you do n't pay it the interest will be capitalized. Another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX indicates that the interest amount of {$760.00} is due on the loan. An administrative forebearance had to be processed because they incorrectly denied my IBR application as not time to apply due to servicing error above. I called and spoke with XXXX # XXXX and she indicated this was an error and she would submit to management to review the interest capitalization and get that taken off since it was not my error and it was a servicing error that caused the issue. On XX/XX/XXXX a letter cam that indicates because I did n't pay the interest bill of {$760.00} that if I did n't remit the outstanding interest payment I was consenting to the capitalized interest. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made my IBR payment of {$490.00} which was due on XX/XX/XXXX. The Monthly Billing Statement dated XX/XX/XXXX was received which indicates on XX/XX/XXXX I made the payment of {$490.00}, however that I was {$490.00} past due and that my current payment due was {$490.00} with a total due on XX/XX/XXXX of {$990.00}. The back of the page indicates that the payment I made on XX/XX/XXXX towards my IBR plan was applied to Interest and that I was past due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to follow up about the fact that it says I am past due even though I timely made my payment towards the IBR plan and that it was applied wrong as well as to follow up on the Interest capitalization review by management. I spoke with a XXXX # XXXX which indicated that the interest capitalization had been submitted and it was just waiting to get back and it should take 7 - 10 business days. I indicated my concern for credit reporting agency since it shows up that I am past due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email indicating that my request to review the interest capitalization was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, but the process was still being reviewed. on XX/XX/XXXX a transaction log from the FedLoanServicing website indicates on XX/XX/XXXX Interest capitalization of {$15000.00} was added on my loan with no documentation supporting it increasing my loan balance form {$120000.00} to {$140000.00}.

7/12/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Incorrect information on your report,,"Under FEMA guidelines for mortgage assistance moratorium, I was entitled to, and applied for, a 3 month mortgage forebearance due to Hurricane Irmas effects in my state of Florida. I spoke with an SPS rep in XX/XX/XXXX about the forebearance and was given word to stop payments and to call again in mid XX/XX/XXXX for further information. I did not make mortgage payments for the months of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX SPS informed me that I would be responsible to repay those three months as a balloon payment in XX/XX/XXXX. The balloon payment obviously defeated the spirit and purpose of the moratorium, was not a reasonable solution, and was therefore not acceptable, so SPS offered a modification plan as another option, which I accepted. I filled out the required paperwork, and followed all instructions. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, however, I still had received no instruction from SPS as to how much to pay, so I sent in a check for the prior amount I had been paying on the original mortgage ( deposited by SPS XX/XX/XXXX - {$470.00} ). Note : This check is the reason why, I think, that I was later reported in XX/XX/XXXX as a 60 day delinquency ( see below ) instead of 90 days. 

Later that month I learned that the modification plan had reduced the monthly payment, so the next check I sent was for the new amount ( deposited XX/XX/XXXX - {$390.00} ). 

I made the following payments in subsequent months : XX/XX/XXXX {$390.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$390.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$390.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$390.00} These are SPS deposit dates. 

All of these payments have been sent ( and deposited by SPS ) on a timely basis, yet SPS reported to the credit bureaus in XX/XX/XXXXthat I was 60 days delinquent, which remains a serious blotch on my credit rating.

Every other lender I know shows your prior statement balance, your payments made, how much went to interest and to principle, and then ending balance. In this way you can see if, for example, your minimum payment of {$750.00} on your student loan payment, only pays down your principle by {$79.00} dollars with the rest going to interest. My loans are consolidated with them, and I have previously raised this issue with customer service, and they had no answer other than the website was being redesigned ( this was over a year ago ). I have figured out how to do this manually, but the average student loan payer will not go to the trouble. You have to go to their "" archived '' old site, then to your emails ( all my communication is electronic ), then gather your monthly statements, then write down your prior balance, payments, interest and principle, and manually review the declining balance. This is how I figured out that on many months only a tiny % of my large payment was going to principle. This to me is a very deceitful way to do business - by making it so difficult to understand the declining balance, and thus how much you are actually paying off without manually tracking it, they are encouraging everyone to remain in huge debt as long as possible. They should be made to put this on the main page of the borrowers ' loan balances - they already have the payment amounts, it would take very little programming to add this. It seems as if Navient is purposely omitting this information to keep borrowers on the hook for as long as possible since if people knew they only had a small amount going to principle they would be motivated to pay their loans off sooner.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",WI,,,Consent provided,Web,1/25/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2310438

However, the company is causing harm to me by repeatedly reporting my account as past due to the credit bureaus, threatening legal action, and refusing to honor my requests for a full accounting of all payments I have made to them since the establishment of this new contract. I have made all payments using cashier 's checks or money orders and I sent the payments via USPS with tracking numbers, so I could verify receipt of the payments. I have already written the company twice regarding this situation ( XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX ) asking them to update my account with them and correct their credit reporting. When I initiated a online dispute with XXXX earlier this year, stating that the account number about which Conn 's is reporting is a closed/invalid account, they upheld the fraudulent reporting by Conn 's. I am sending another letter today to Conn 's and all XXXX credit bureaus to request the correction of this information immediately.

3. XXXX XXXX received email advising bank name changed from GE Capital Retail Bank to Synchrony Bank. Email states "" GE Capital Retail Bank XXXX "" GECRB '' XXXX -- the issuer of your CARECREDIT Account -- is now Synchrony Bank. Do n't worry, most things remain the same. What is changing are the email addresses for XXXX ''. 
4. Never did they advise that the purchase amount needed to be over {$200.00} to be eligible for the interest free promotion. I called complained, they refused to go by the original contract and charged interest. I continued to make timely payments and pay the interest even though it should have been interest free. 
5. I called in XXXX XXXX to see what the promotional amount/details were and was advised the 6 month interest free promotion was for charges over {$200.00}. 
6. XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I incurred a {$370.00} charge at the XXXX XXXX Vets, and was advised that my Care Credit card had been denied. 
7. I contacted Care Credit and spoke with XXXX who advised the account had been closed as "" high risk ''. When question XXXX became firm and raised his voice. I requested a supervisor. 
8. I spoke with a supervisor XXXX who was worse than XXXX when it came to aggressiveness and raising her voice. She stated I was lying as the promotional value was always {$300.00}, never {$200.00} and certainly was never any amount charged. She refused to view my history to prove she was incorrect. She also refused to reinstate the card, advising they had done a "" Credit check '' on me and decided to close the account as "" High risk ''. She told me they could do a credit check any time they wanted and close the account whether it was in good standing or not!! I then disconnected my call with XXXX as she was absolutely worthless in the customer service dept. She also advised they sent a letter stating it was closed, which they did not. Nor did they state it was closed in XXXX XXXX when I contacted them regarding the promotional details. 
9. I currently owe the vet for the {$370.00} charge, and feel that Care Credit should reinstate the card as they never advised it was closed, not should it have been closed. THE SIMPLY CLOSED IT AS THEY WERE NOT MAKING ANY INTEREST OFF FROM IT. THIS IS NOTHING BUT FRAUD. Care Credit/Synchrony bank has violated the contract. 
10. Remedial Action : I want the credit card back with the exact same promotion as promised, received initially and as the contract stated, at which time I will again make timely payments.

The Assignment of Mortgage that supposedly assigns the mortgage to the Plaintiff in the case, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is fraudulent for the following reasons : 1. Assignment assigns the mortgage on XXXX XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX trust. This is not possible because this trust closed in XXXX XXXX. Two years prior to the assignment of mortgage. 
2. The assignment assigns the mortgage to the trust approximately 20 days AFTER the filing of the XXXX XXXX to Foreclosure and the Foreclosure Complaint. This would make it impossible for the current plaintiff, XXXX. 
Bank XXXX XXXX, to file the complaint because they would not have had standing at the time they filed the complaint. 
3. The assignment has a clause backdating the date it was filed in order to serve their purpose. This is considered fraud specially when the Note bears no date to show that in fact that note was assigned on the backdated date. Backdating an assignment is a fraud and would make it null and void. 
4. The assignment of mortgage was signed by XXXX XXXX and notarized by XXXX XXXX XXXX, known robosigners. 
5. The assignment of mortgage was prepared and filed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, foreclosure mill attorney who was disbarred for using fraudulent documents to file foreclosure complaints. 
6. In searching the XXXX records for XXXX XXXX, the mortgage loan in question does not appear anywhere in the mortgage loan tape of the loans that were part of the XXXX XXXX trust. 
7. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX during the foreclosure process in XXXX they provided a note which was endorsed and it stated : Pay to the order of XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX as trustee for XXXX XXXX without recourse and signed by XXXX XXXX. 5 YEARS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX provided to bankruptcy court during my bankruptcy a note with a blank endorsement. This is after an original with an endorsement had been provided to the court. Honestly they must have magical powers to be able to remove and endorsement that is endorsed to XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX as trustee for XXXX XXXX and then 5 years later the note that is provided in Federal court has a blank endorsement and not endorsed to anyone. Again, this is fraud. I sent letters to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX, the judges presiding over my case, the Chief Judge and the Foreclosure Administrative Judge and to the clerk of XXXX XXXX XXXX Courts requesting a full investigation of these allegations and requesting proof that they in fact own said mortgage but have never received complete and concrete answers to any of my suspicions nor has an investigation been done on my land records or court records. Although I have requested answers and clear and definite proof with documentation as to their ownership of said mortgage and note to date, my questions have not been answered and no documentation showing clear and definite proof of their ownership of said mortgage loan has ever been provided. I keep on getting the runaround from everyone and all they do is response with things like, it is legal to backdate an assignment of mortgage or there is no fraud. I am attaching a letter that I sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX Mortgage Fraud Department with all my concerns. None of my concerns have been addressed nor have they provided any documentation proving that they are in fact the owners of said mortgage and note.",,OCWEN LOAN SERVICING LLC,FL,331XX,,Consent provided,Web,3/11/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1827895

10/12/2017,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Delay in processing application,"I visited Commerce Bank in XXXX XXXX Missouri XXXX, I have been a customer there for several years and someone was fraudulently using ach debits on my personal checking account to make payments for their own account. This was the second time within 2 weeks this matter occurred, to speed up the process in order to get my money back I had to go there in person to sign an affidavit. During my visit with the bank manager XXXX he claimed there was nothing the bank could do and this is what I have to do each time this happens. I explained my income is Social Security money and I was worried if this kept happening that my money could all be tied up and I would start bouncing auto payments or missing payments I have due. He said they had a good deal on a credit card with the bank that had no interest for a year and could payoff another credit card and be charged only 5 % interest on that and on overdrafts, it was better than having the standard overdraft protection the bank offers although there is a fee of {$20.00} each time instead of the {$37.00}. He said, I can you an answer in no time and it will only take a few minutes if that. I agreed to start the process and decided I would payoff my XXXX XXXX XXXX and close it out as a result. During the application process this manager just up and asked me "" how long have you been XXXX? '' I was stunned, no one ever from a business stand point had ever asked such a question ... very personal and unrelated to finance or my ability to finance I thought. Almost simultaneously following that very disturbing and inappropriate question question, the process which I was assured would only take a few minutes changed to .... '' they 're going to have to review your credit and consider a limit, I 'll have to get back to you later today maybe ''. I was in complete shut down, stunned that I was being singled out for being XXXX, asked questions unrelated to business, and more or less spinning with rejection from this perception as it was being created in front of my face over being on fixed income for being XXXX, simply put "" not worthy ''. 

I called to complain about this by asking for the Managers supervisor to return my call. I explained what was going on and this person chose to defend and put words in place for his manager, stating "" I do n't know what happened and there are two sides to every story, maybe he was just making conversation ''? 

You mean prying, filtering, screening, and discriminating against me for being XXXX? 

First I 'm told it only takes a few minutes to get an answer, the discovery that I 'm on XXXX is made and then it 's delayed and now they are unsure. 

I just finished off a car loan on 5 years in XXXX XXXX, I have a XXXX XXXX XXXX with a XXXX dollar limit ... no one there asked of my condition. I have XXXX XXXX with a XXXX dollar limit, no one there asked me anything about my XXXX. I have a new car loan with XXXX XXXX started in XXXX XXXX i HAVE PERFECT PAYMENT RECORDS AND HAVE HANDLED ALL MY ACCOUNTS EXTREMELY RESPONSIBLE. THIS ALSO INCLUDES MY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS OF XXXX A MONTH THAT HAVE HAD FOR 25 YEARS NOW .... all responsibly paid on. 

I even explained to the manager I was recently pre- approved by Commerce for a Mortgage Loan of over {$100000.00} on my complete own as an individual, THE LOAN DEPT THERE DID NOT ASK A THING ABOUT MY XXXX OR HAVE IT AS AN ISSUE TO CONSIDER ... THEY PRE-APPROVED ME. 

MY CREDIT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. This is my point and why I 'm shocked and dismayed that Commerce Bank was now making my illness an issue to hold back a process. I do n't believe for one minute that anyone with my score and a job would have been scrutinized or screened like I was for something that I was assured would only take a few minutes tops .... the fact that I had to disclose I was on social security is verified through a letter of benefits by SSA that I can and have had to obtain, the SSA makes these available each new year to people for this very reason. 

Discrimination is when you do n't make all the people applying have the same requirements, is everyone applying at Commerce Bank asked "" how long have you been XXXX ''. 

Worse is this, I understand asking me if I have had benefit income for a certain amount of time, I have no problem discussing my financial position for credit application matters. I do not understand at all "" how long have you been XXXX "" applied to qualifying for a loan though? I get XXXX income, how long I have that is one thing but how long have I been XXXX is not relevant and wholly inappropriate. I had to explain this to two grown adult men who could n't seem to realize what they were asking and/or defending of being asked. Are you kidding me? 

Commerce Bank has the luxury of knowing I 'm on XXXX because # 1 I had to express this over having my money stolen from my account and explaining it 's ssa fixed income. # 2 I had to disclose this for proof of income. By asking me how long I have been XXXX they began a screening process that they ca n't apply on anyone else or will, just the XXXX. Due to the fact that I was assured it only took a few minutes and know I have good credit and a great credit history, this delay created to "" further review '' me and application it is pure discrimination based on me ( or anyone for that matter ) being XXXX. 

I was 100 % SINGLED OUT where a person with a paycheck would not be I know your agency does not practice in opinions, legal or political and I respect that but if I need to prove my XXXX and provide you my SSA Benefit Letter, I gladly will. 

Funny thing, I applied for several mortgage approvals over the past two years and credit cards from other companies, I was approved by all and none of them had the option to see me in person and the one place where I have banked for years and they do know me and can see me? I get scrutinized the most and put on hold. 

At XXXX I called this manager and informed him I no longer was interested in obtaining a credit card with Commerce Bank. He told me it was too late to stop the process but he will try and do it anyway, I will call you back later and let you know what I find out. 

It 's XXXX am XXXX XXXX now, no one from Commerce Bank as contacted me or attempted to contact me. I 'm giving him 24 hours before I call him to point out it 's been 24 hours .... 

I suggest no one who is XXXX use this institution, it 's pretty clear how they practice their craft at Commerce Bank and it includes finding ways to NOT serve those of us all in the same boat, the boat of denial XXXX has created for the XXXX who bank there",,COMMERCE BANK,MO,631XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10/12/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2700102

The apartment claimed we did not give adequate notice of vacating. We were told by the apartment complex that we would receive a written notice of amount due following move out. This written notice was never received. We requested a written statement from the collection company and received it after 2 requests. After receiving written statement with amount due, we reached out to the collection company regarding payments to resolve the amount. Spoke with a gentleman who informed me that making a payment and continuing to pay each month would prevent the amount from being placed on our credit reports as a collection account. Following that conversation, I immediately went online and made a payment. I then called and informed the representative that I had made the payment. I did this to be certain that I was following the correct procedures to protect our credit and resolve the debt and was assured that I was. Within one week of making the payment, the company hit both mine and my wifes credit with a collection account, which was extremely detrimental to our score. I then spoke with the representative at the collection agency again, letting him know that a collection account was placed on our credit, and he informed me that he would be speaking with his manager to get it resolved and removed and would be calling me back that afternoon.

2/9/2017,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"For the past four years since I have been out of college I have been struggling trying to figure out how to repay my student loans. I was under the belief there was an income based payment plan I could get enrolled into. I was told there was nothing I could do online multiple times during this four year period and that I had to fill out forms and send them in the mail to them. I did do this I believe 3 times total I sent the paperwork to the address I was given each time and each time I was told they never received the paperwork. I have a multitude of phone calls that I can remember very specifically saying ca n't I do something online based on my income and was told multiple times this was the only way. So each time I was told the best thing to do was to take forbearance on the loan and refile the paperwork. I finally got frustrated enough after reading an article about a lawsuit against Navient recently for this very reason being unlawful and that I was not the only XXXX experiencing it, and called Navient and demanded to know all of my options. Again I received the run around and was questioned about where I was mailing things until I poked more and said I know there is an online resolution I read about it in the article about the lawsuit against you. As soon as this was said I was told by the gentlemen on the phone there was an income based repayment plan which is filed online. I had asked multiple times if XXXX dollars a month would suffice for a payment and was told the lowest with my income which has n't changed this entire time would have been XXXX. On a {$25000.00} a year salary, before taxes, I could not afford XXXX a month but have since learned this entire time it would have been XXXX a month with the correct repayment plan. I finished my phone call by asking him how much my current loan was at and was told I currently owed just over {$25000.00}. I then asked how much the loans began at when I left school, to which I was told just over {$10000.00}. So i barraged him with questions asking if there was anywhere I could complain to because for the past four years I have gained {$15000.00} in debt, which is more than I racked up the entire time I was in college, because the people who were supposed to help me chose not to. To this I was told there was nothing he or anyone else could do to relieve any of the interest gained and suggested since I was going forward with the income based repayment plan that I take forbearance so that my loans would n't risk defaulting. To my dismay I agreed to another 30-day forbearance to ensure this would n't happen and to give myself adequate time to resolve the issue. 

I believe this can not be legal practice I should be able to trust the student loan company to help me pay them back not bury myself so far into debt that I can not get out. If someone had told me from the get go exactly how to handle my student loans at this point I would almost have them completely paid off but instead I have an endless amount of debt that in four years has increased by % XXXX. I am beyond fed up and disappointed that I would have been better off in life had I not even gone to a higher education. 

I would beg anyone looking into this case to demand my phone call logs and recordings specifically because the amount of frustration and misleading these people gave and did to me is unbelievable and prime example of the suit currently in progress.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NY,,,Consent provided,Web,2/9/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2337376

I was approved "" pending verification '' of credit, income, etc, for a {$35000.00} 60 month loan at roughly 13 %, with around a 16 % apr. 

I submitted all of my income for verification, and was told that {$50000.00} of my {$200000.00} in income couldn't be verified or used for the loan as it is rental income. They did "" verify '' {$150000.00} of income, but told me I no longer qualified for the {$35000.00}, that they could only extend {$25000.00} based on the income they could verify. I agreed to move forward with a new application, verifying they wouldn't pull my credit again ( they used the same credit hit and score for both applications ). They reiterated that this the new loan application for the lower amount would still be a consolidation loan, paying off {$25000.00} of my existing debt, which is the case. 

They came back with an offer which included a rate literally 2x higher then my original offer, sighting higher "" debt to income ratio. '' I asked them to lower the loan amount to get the "" dti '' in line with the original offer, so I could get the original rate offered ( I did the calculation, and the "" dti '' ratio on the new offer of {$25000.00} with the lower income of {$150000.00}, is actually LOWER then it was with the {$35000.00} loan offer with {$200000.00} in income!! ). They said they would not do this. 

This is a clear "" bait and switch '' and a violation of banking Regulation B and other Fair Lending Laws. As I understand it, they can not charge a different rate to clients with the same credit profile ( credit score, dti ratio ). They are claiming my rate went up because the "" dti '' changed from one application to the next. I know it did not. The lower loan, with the lower income, came to a lower ratio, and should have lowered my rate, if anything.

On XX/XX/2016, I checked my travel warning for that card and discovered that it was gone. So, I put in a new travel warning ( please see records of my complaint attached ). This, of course, confirms the problems with Citi Computer System. 
On XX/XX/2016, I emailed faxed a letter to Citi Cards XXXX XXXX XXXX and the person who I thought to be the manager of XXXX Executive Office, XXXX XXXX ( please see fax attached ). In that letter, I summed up all the problems I had with Simplicity XXXX and asked them to make sure that the ThankYou XXXX card is ready for use and would not be blocked. At that point, the card balance was {$140.00} and the limit {$5000.00} XX/XX/2016, the card was rejected for {$5.00} medicines purchase at XXXX pharmacy. then for buying and groceries at XXXX. I came home, discovered yet another fraud warning and realized that, most likely, I would not be able to use this card either. That it would be blocked again and again, just as Simplicity XXXX had been. Unfortunately, that prediction came fully true. 
Attached is the detailed record of my please and demands and the Citi denials of there being any problem and lies, and even the bad science fiction inventions ( see letter of XXXX XXXX of XX/XX/2016, attributing the card processing failure to the bad machine used for the processing ). Of course, it does not matter for that Executive Office employee that the card had been used at the very same store for nearly SIX YEARS. 
My correspondence with Citi Bank, for both Citi Cards ( see attachments to the present complaint and to that about XXXX card ), includes my letters to XXXX XXXX, the Citi Card CEO, and XXXX XXXX, the person who I presumed to be the Manager of Executive Office because a couple of year ago it was she, who finally resolved a problem, about which another XXXX volumes of correspondence had been written. I have also left multiple voice messages at XXXX XXXX voice mail. 
There had been no replies from XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/2016 to XX/XX/2016, i.e. nearly two months, during which I was stranded in a foreign country, where walking with cash is neither safe, no recommended, without credit card. = please see continued",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MA,023XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10/25/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2175261

I checked with the XXXX XXXX Tax assessor web site and saw my taxes were delinquent and a 21 % penalty.This is a huge problem because property gets sold and then you have to go thru a 3rd party to buy it back. I was so shocked because I know Banks have strict rules that govern paying escrow payments on time and accurately. After multiple phone calls and BBT employees telling me the bank will pay and I would not be responsible for the penalty, I sent faxes and finally a legal "" Notice of Error '' to document my written request. My taxes were finally paid after 2 weeks but BBT also charged my escrow for the {$550.00} penalty.My position is that Red Flags should have been raised when they issued a {$16.00} check to pay my taxes. Where are the safe guards, common sense and professionalism in paying {$16.00} in taxes on a large mortgage? They are blaming me because they paid the wrong tax ticket.

1/6/2017,Credit card,,Transaction issue,,"I applied for a pnc credit online and was approved with a credit limit of {$1000.00} and cash advance limit if {$100.00}. One of the selling points that made me apply for the card is that it provided overdraft protection to my existing pnc personal accounts. A few days later I used PNCs VirtualWallet ( online/mobile banking ) to transfer {$3000.00} from my personal checking to my personal savings so I thought. What I actually did was transfer the funds from my savings into my credit card that I was just approved for but had yet to receive in the mail therefore the card was not activated. The {$3000.00} transfer was processed as a credit card over payment- when I never activated the card. I noticed the mistake and contacted PNC the next day to have it corrected. I was told that it takes up to 10 days to refund me my "" over payment '' from an account I never activated so it should never t have even accepted the payment. This is now day 5 and I 've been assessed XXXX {$36.00} NSF FEES to date because all of my liquid funds were put onto the credit card account that was n't even activated. Again, this credit card was supposed to protect my personal accounts from overdraft but is not because it 's not activated. At this point I do n't even want the card or to continue banking with PNC but in order for me not to receive these fees that they should not be assessing me because the credit card should not have accepted the accidental over payment they are going to force me to activate the credit card that is the cause. This is preditory. Even if I were to activate this card it will only allow me a {$100.00} cash advance which does n't even cover the fees. Mean while there 's {$3000.00} of my money on this card as a over payment that I can not access. It took 3 seconds for Pnc to allow a payment ( that technically should not be allowed on a account that 's not activated ) and 10 days to return it?. My bills are not being paid including and I am in a state of crises because all of my accounts are overdrawn but PNC HAS {$3000.00} of my money and wo n't even utilize the overdraft protection that I signed up for when I applied for the credit card.",,PNC Bank N.A.,PA,,,Consent provided,Web,1/6/2017,Closed,Yes,No,2279172

He and I had simply discussed some numbers, and I said that it sounded good. He tried to take my appraisal payment right then and there, before I ever saw the numbers on paper and gave my intent to proceed.

The first problem was that the "" lender credits '' he promised me were no where close to what was actually given to me. He told me repeatedly that the appraisal was going to be refunded to me. It was not, and I was made out to be the XXXX that didn't understand. Meanwhile, I am a XXXX XXXX, I do this every day. I know the verbiage, I know the business, I know when someone tells me I '' m getting my appraisal fee back, vs it is POC and will reduce my cash to close.

Finally, the closing. The closing date was missed. They then sent a notary to my in-laws home in Alabama who apparently lost the deed. I then had to resign, was scheduled with two different attorneys, then was told I actually didn't have to sign. Confused, yet? So was I. It finally funded about a week later, and I was wired my cash back at closing that was {$110.00} short of the Final Closing Disclosure that I signed. They did not catch this. I caught this. Imagine what they are doing to people who are not as versed as I am in the loan process. The loan officer was garbage and a liar. The processor was ok, but still was below par.

However, once I discovered that the account was negative I went in branch to fix the issue and make the account current. In branch I was told that they could not accept my check as a checking account deposit. They said that it had to be deposited into my savings and transferred into my checking. After the deposit I was informed that the funds available on the deposit of {$2000.00} was {$400.00}. I was told the account was positive and that the remaining funds were available to me. On Tuesday morning over {$140.00} in o/d fees were levied against the account. Wells Fargo 24hr Banking informed me that they would only waive XXXX fees ( {$70.00} ) and that I would be forced to pay the remaining XXXX. I do not have a continuous o/d history with Wells or a habitual o/d problem. These fees are a result of branch misinformation and the fact that my deposit was put into my savings account per the branch teller and manager 's decision. I was on the phone with 24hr banking for over an hour with reps and manager XXXX XXXX in the call center based in XXXX. I was refused waiver of the additional fees. 

These fees are based on misinformation and errors from Wells Fargo, despite this Wells is unwilling to reverse the transactions. I was willing to pay the fee for my actual o/d incident on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$35.00} ) but these additional fees are not my responsibility and compared to other retail banks are VERY high at {$35.00} each. 

I informed Wells Fargo that I am a recent graduate and relocated and that my funds are needed. They still will not reverse the fees based on their error. 

This is very upsetting. I just want my {$70.00} back. Please help me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,90028,,Consent provided,Web,6/22/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1978643

With the discount, the price was between {$35.00} and {$36.00}. 
Heres where the issue came up. The cashier rang up my clothes as the {$40.00} price and the discount was not applied. To avoid any future issues, I asked to pay off the full amount immediately after my purchase. What ended up happening was she only paid off {$35.00} of the {$40.00} because she did not notice the discount was not applied. 
So about five dollars was left on the card for several months and the balance build up on the 29 percent annual interest. I had no idea of the balance until I finally got a letter in the mail from XXXX XXXX saying that I had owed {$71.00}. 
A few days later I went into XXXX to resolve the issue. They told me to call XXXX XXXX which is who the card is issued through. I believe this bank is located in Delaware. 
I call and tell them the situation. They tell me that they can not just clear the {$71.00}, some of it has to be paid. So I get them to lower the balance to {$17.00} which seemed a lot better than {$71.00}. The XXXX manager reimbursed me the {$17.00} so everything was cool after that. 
Then I looked at my Fico Score on XXXX XXXX which I do every month. It had dropped from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX all the way down to XXXX in XXXX of XXXX which i when I found out about this. 
Since then, I have gotten my score back up to XXXX. 
These are the only missed payments I have ever had. 
I recently talked with a banker at XXXX XXXX and he said I should 100 percent dispute this problem.",,Alliance Data Card Services,MN,551XX,,Consent provided,Web,2/19/2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3155792

Even though it was in my name, we both used the card for both of our use, which included purposes for the home we bought in XX/XX/XXXX. However, since the credit reached a substantial high of {$6500.00}. along with other credit cards we had that we made home improvements on, we decided to refinance on a XXXX mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX Mortgage eliminating these debts. Unfortunately, XXXX child later, and in XXXX, we divorced and I 'm left in a strict foreclosure after losing my job due to the economy crisis in XXXX and working XXXX jobs to meet the mortgage and during XXXX job I took a fall which left me on XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX, still fighting for XXXX. However, let me be brief ... XXXX, XXXX apparently sold off debt to XXXX XXXX , XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, that 's XXXX years later. I 've never had it on my credit report since then. Like I said, I refinanced the debt in XXXX. When I received the letter from XXXX XXXX , XXXX inn XX/XX/XXXX ( which by the way is over the statute of limitations in CT ). I immediately advised them that this credit was refinanced in XX/XX/XXXX and she said ok I 'll take care of it. There must have been an error. I was never notified any time after that, but I was taken to small claims court in XXXX XXXX where there was a judgement against me yet no papers were ever sent to me for {$5000.00} judgement XXXX months later. Then they sold the debt off to another credit agency called Resolute Credit who is now again taking me back to court and threatening me when they know that they can not go into my funds because I am on worker 's compensation and I was receiving child support which just ended and my son is living with me until he goes to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. However, this man legally threatened to go after my checking account again for the same amount knowing I just turned into the court via fax An Exempt for Execution which I should n't have had to do in the first place because the Bank ( XXXX ) should have been able to protect my money with my Divorce Decree on File as well as my XXXX Check. They should have marked my account as XXXX!! And they did not do their job. So yes, I believe this should be made public for others to see. So it does n't happen to them. And their should be laws put against these Credit Card/Collection Agencies that do this because now I have this on my credit report which ruins my credit report while I now need to look for a place to live and when they need to check my credit score, it brought it down traumatically.

7/24/2017,Debt collection,Credit card debt,False statements or representation,Told you not to respond to a lawsuit they filed against you,"A. Problem history synopsis : Medical ER visit in XX/XX/XXXX got behind in payments. Final payment in XXXX which lasted until XXXX XXXX, then account charged off and went to collections for 30 days, then collection attorney. Bank of America was told about medical hardship in XXXX before charge off several times as was the nonprofit and the attorney later. Bank of America was asked to provide forbearance arrangements but none were offered or responded to. B. Dunning Letter issued in XXXX around 40 days after charge off. Call was attempted to dispute amount. C. XXXX XXXX filed a lawsuit filing in my County civil ( lower court ). Bank of America, NA V. MY NAME D. I attempted to have account placed on Debt Management Plan DMP with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I had an account with before. XXXX XXXX took my money, told me in writing that I could show the DMP to the judge to waive and dismiss the suit, and then sent the money with a proposal to Bank. The Bank kept the money and said "" no '' to the proposal since it was "" in legal. '' E. I have a phone call documented and recorded with Bank of America in which customer service representative who may have told me it was an attempt to collect a debt nevertheless told me they did not "" own it '' anymore, implying that they sold it to XXXX XXXX and or XXXX XXXX XXXX. It turns out that the Bank still owns it and the collection attorney only represents them. F. Call # 1 to collection attorney phone call documented and recorded : XXXX XXXX XXXX representative coercing payment and arrangement plans against a default judgement that did not exist. Extended payment plan offered where the "" judgement '' would stay and not be removed. "" No other options '' existed etc. The color of law used against me to extract payment and collect a debt. My due process rights were usurped and obfuscated. The color of the law of a default judgement was used against me in order to collect a debt. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX obfuscated and clouded my rights as a consumer with a false statement about a judgement which did not exist I did not have any moment to present an attorney for them to speak to. This was especially apparent with second phone call. G. Second Call # 2 to collection attorney I asked again about an extended payment plan so I asked for a copy of that to review. They told me I had 30 days to get it back to them, however upon receiving the balance was incorrect and wrong. The paperwork had to be back in 10-14 days. The time passed due to the time that the proposal took to be mailed to me. So that passed due to fact I had a car accident. This customer service representative told me "" to shred and or tear up any lawsuit notification service papers that I might receive. '' This constitutes advice by XXXX XXXX XXXX such that they told me not to respond to a lawsuit they filed against me which would mean losing the lawsuit by default. Furthermore, because the first call ( point F above ) purported a default judgement against me, I was NOT able to seek advice of an attorney, thereby once again losing not only my consumer rights but my constitutional rights as an American citizen. H. Many faxes sent to XXXX XXXX attorney : ( 1 ) general dispute, ( 2 ) dispute of balance on "" agreed judgement '' as well as deceptive timelines for due dates given by Call # 2 & paperwork, ( 3 ) dispute # 3 asking for information regarding all credit cards ' lines which were consolidated into the present & original origination details including state of origination and copy of original application, ( 4 ) simple letter asking for a new agreed judgement with correct balance to review for consideration. No disputes were responded or handled correctly. I received one call from XXXX XXXX of Bank America in North Carolina. It was not clear what his phone call was about. I have disputed both the original debt accuracy via fax directly to Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX. They did not respond. I disputed the accuracy of both their original stated balance due as well as the balance listed on the agreed judgement papers since I have had made several payments since XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of America. I. Improper ( potentially illegal ) servicing techniques and Talking to a 3rd party about my debt : Visit # 1 -  XXXX dropped off a person to my wife 's brother in law. They told him they had papers from Bank. Brother-in-law asked to see them. Courier showed them to him the paperwork showing Bank of America, NA vs MY NAME Visit # 2 - lady drove to my parents house. Video exists of visitor showing paperwork to my mother who can confirm that the Bank 's name and my name were on the papers such that Bank of America, NA vs. MY NAME. These visits to 3rd parties were made to look like they were trying to find me, but they were really pressuring and embarrassing me in order to retrieve signature to the agreed judgement as described above G. Please note : My mother had night terrors for 3 days after this visit. She is XXXX years old. J. No agreed judgement was signed nor agreed to because the balance was incorrect. Also, the first XXXX XXXX XXXX employee who called me, XXXX XXXX, was documented on phone as saying there was a default judgement which would not be removed unless I paid in one payment, two payment or a four payment arrangement. This turned out to be false. The balance was never verified or corrected and I find this to be completely deceptive to me the consumer. K. Other Violations of Texas debt collection practices : 1. Texas Fair Debt Collection Practices Act part 392.202 violations occurred include parts ( A ) & ( B ) upon points 1, 2 & 3. 2. Requirement to provide address to send payment during phone calls attempting to collect on a debt in Texas : On no phone call by XXXX XXXX XXXX or phones calls going back to XXXX with Bank of America and or XXXX XXXX was an address provided for sending payment. This presented a highly ambiguous, deceptive, and confusing path of becoming compliant especially before and right after the charge-off period. L. Suit by XXXX XXXX XXXX did not provide any customary 2 week notice and was done without properly notifying me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",TX,770XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/24/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2583703

9/27/2018,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"As of XX/XX/XXXX I have been negligently dealt with by XXXX  XXXX XXXX and all of the credit bureaus on numerous occasions. In XXXX I refinanced my home, and XXXX XXXX ( lender ) sent a payoff to XXXX   XXXX XXXX in a timely manor to pay off the amount. ( Attached is proof from the title company of payment being sent out and clearing date ) XXXX  XXXX XXXX processed the payment three days after the payment due date and a late fee was administered after the account was paid off and closed. No formal contact was made in the way of e-mail, phone calls or letter to myself or XXXX XXXX over the fee. Over the next five months, the late fee gained interest to a balance over {$200.00}. The amount was reported to the credit bureaus and in doing so, my credit score plummeted. It was not until XXXX that a credit report revealed the 90+ late on a zero balance and was paid off in XXXX of XXXX. 

Since XXXX of XXXX, I have filed formal disputes 3 times with the Bank to reverse a 90+ day late, zero balance on my credit report. On the first dispute in XX/XX/XXXX, there was contact between XXXX XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX XXXX about the mishap and it was deemed a bank error. There was agreement from XXXX XXXX XXXX that the 90+ day late report would be taken off the report. There was no instruction  from XXXX XXXX XXXX that any further proof or writing was needed from me and that everything would be removed from the report in 60 days. In XXXX of XXXX upon a credit inquiry, I discovered the 90+ day late was in fact not removed from the credit report and that the XXXX XXXX XXXX did not even formerly get the dispute to the credit bureaus to be removed. ( I found this out by calling and asking all of the credit bureaus.. I then filed investigations to have the score moved via the credit bureaus to XXXX XXXX XXXX.. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX after hearing back from only one credit bureau ( vague letter attached from Experian ), again, upon credit inquiry, I had discovered yet again that the score had not been restored to it former state. Not only had I not heard back from any of the bureaus apart from one, but I was not even administered a confirmation or dispute number to check the progress of my investigations apart from Experian. XX/XX/XXXX, I called back to XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told that they could not go back into my records that far, and to file another investigation/dispute through the bureaus ... I called back five minutes later and was transferred to a gentlemen that had access to my records dating further back than 60 days. He said that he would submit a 3rd dispute on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX to have the 90+ day report removed in my favor, and ensured it was sent out to all bureaus. I also asked for a letter stating as proof that the Bank was in favor of reversing my late report. ( Letter attached ). The letter was sent to me XX/XX/XXXX and is also in my record on my account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I checked back within 60 days to the bureaus ( the bureaus that I could actually get through to talk to someone with ) and discovered XXXX XXXX XXXX has not only NOT been in contact with any of the bureaus ( in the way of filing a dispute ) but that when the credit bureaus contacted them back in XXXX when I had asked, and that XXXX  XXXX XXXX declined the investigation asking to have the 90+ late removed, because the late fee was legit. Despite having all of my notes and having proof that the late fee should not be something the card holders credit would be affected by. I called back this last Monday XX/XX/XXXX to ask XXXX  XXXX XXXX what I would need to do to finally get the 90+ day late report removed. They sent me to a supervisor only to be transferred again to someone who was a account specialist. Upon reaching the specialist I was hung up on and not callled back. I immediately called back and went through the whole process again. I spoke to a woman who would not give me her name or contact info. We spent Time looking though my account to see that what happened and why the Bank would not reverse my report.

10/19/2018,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"On XX/XX/2018 4 payments were received by Wells Fargo. Each payment was done by check. Normally, Wells Fargo would post the payment on the credit card account and then the following day the check would clear the Wells Fargo checking account that the checks were drawn off. But this time, that did not happen. Wells Fargo did not post the payments but rather collected the money and then one business day later the payment was posted to the account. 

I contacted Wells Fargo about this issue and was informed that payment can take 1-3 days to post but after explaining to the customer service rep that in the past that was not the case and this only began to happen once the credit card account was closed. I was transferred to a supervisor who explained the same thing but after informing them that my concern was not being addressed, I was then transferred to another rep who continued to explain the same thing to me about payments taking 1-3 days to post. 

I interrupted the last representative and advised them that this only happened after I closed the credit card account and based on the actions of Wells Fargo, this appeared to be a deceptive practice. I was then informed that my issue would be escalated to another department who would be contacting me within 1 business day. I was provided with case # XXXX and provided that department 's phone # as XXXX. 

As I researched further I came upon the last 3 check payments that were sent to Wells Fargo and found the following information : On XX/XX/2018, 3 payments posted to the credit card account {$23.00}, {$26.00} and {$24.00}. As XX/XX/2018 fell on a Friday, the checks cleared my Wells Fargo checking account on XX/XX/2018. 

This is why I believe that Wells Fargo is once again engaging in deceptive practices as other financial institutions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX do not collect funds and then post a payment. The same can be said about other financial institutions such as my auto loan.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,927XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/19/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3050880

On XX/XX/XXXX, I prepaid a car rental with XXXX for a small car offer as from XXXX. When I arrived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, I found that XXXX was represented by XXXX XXXX. I experienced a bait and switch fraud, with the false claim that there were no small cars available despite the fact that I had reserved the car over five months in advance and despite the fact that their lot was filled with small cars. I'm XXXX, suffering from XXXX  XXXX and had about seventy pounds of luggage. Under duress, I was forced to accept a large vehicle with no working low beam headlights and with a faulty navigation system ( despite the fact that I had my own. ) They displayed no willingness to refund my prepayment as an alternative, and of course that would also have left me with high rates for no reservation. After returning the car in good order, I found a charge on my credit card for {$120000.00}. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, provided me with positively no explantion for these charges despite requests, do I contested the charges with XXXX. They provisionally removed the charges then recently reistated the charges with very little accounting or verification from XXXX XXXX. I have since re-contested the charges, but to date with no resolution. The following letter to them cites a number of facts and documentation on bait and switch by the parties mentioned : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Billing Dispute XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, DE XXXX XXXX Case Ref. No. XXXX Dear Sirs : Please immediate and permanently remove the XXXX XXXX charge of {$1200.00}. I have tried in vain to get a full accounting for this illegal charge for over ninety days. You reversed your suspension without any detailed accounting for the charge and I have received none from XXXX XXXX despite repeated requests. There is no justification for this charge nor was there any agreement on my part. Under rules of the account agreement, you are therefore obligated to permanently remove this charge. 

Thank you for the documentation you supplied of the illegal bait and switch engaged in by XXXX XXXX in collusion with XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am passing that evidence on to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and to the Illinois Attorney General. When I arrived at XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX to pick up my prepaid rental car, I was directed to XXXX XXXX as representative of XXXX, in whose name the car was prepaid.

I am XXXX years old, had considerable luggage, and was suffering from XXXX XXXX. They claimed no small car was available, despite the fact that I had prepaid for one over five months earlier and despite the fact that their lot was FULL of much smaller cars during a down season. The car I received was in poor working order. Low beam headlights didnt work and the navigation system, didnt fully function. I didnt want a navigation system and fortunately had my own to use. There was positively no justification for the switch and the car should not have been rented. Here are references to their ongoing bait and switch scam : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In the event that you choose not to honor the card agreement by removing this charge, I will of course be forced to file against you and other parties concerned in my local small claims court.

4/25/2017,Vehicle loan or lease,Lease,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Termination fees or other problem when ending the lease early,"We had problems with the vehicle I leased from  Kia Finance  from the very beginning. There were check engine lights that would periodically come on. I took the vehicle to my Kia dealership   XXXX  Kia  in  XXXX , MI on  XXXX   XXXX , because I was concerned by these lights and I was told by them that they could not detect an issue. I suggested changing the oil and doing a more thorough inspection but they advised that it was not necessary. Eventually the vehicle died and I was told it was because the oil was never changed. I was disturbed by this because the vehicle had been to an authorized  Kia Service Center  multiple times and even when I suggested an oil change was told by these supposed expert professionals that they could not detect any issues and told an oil change was n't necessary, multiple times when the vehicle was brought in. We had the vehicle towed to the  XXXX   Kia  dealership and was informed that they would contact us to see what they could do. Months went by without us receiving any word from them, until I received a bill in the mail recently for {$9800.00}. This included {$8900.00} in unpaid lease payments, {$400.00} disposition fee, and {$530.00} in official fees and taxes. The bill also indicates that the {$9800.00} payment is due within 15 days of the notice. This is totally unreasonable. When I contacted  K  ia Finance  they advised that they could not even discuss payment arrangements until the account went to Collections. I do not think this is right that I am being asked to pay for a vehicle that was ruined though I did my due diligence and took it into a  Kia service shop multi ple times to voice my concerns with the warning lights that would come on from time to time and even recommended an oil change, which ultimately ended up being the reason why we were told that the engine died. It is also completely unfair that my credit will be ruined by this unjust bill of {$9800.00} that is due in a ridiculous amount of time, 15 days. I do n't think that anything should be owed on the vehicle and want this to be immediately removed from my credit report.",,HYUNDAI CAPITAL AMERICA,MI,490XX,,Consent provided,Web,4/25/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2465756

My wife and I about two years ago had to file for a mortgage modification with XXXX XXXX XXXX to lower our payment because we were struggling with the payment then. Now this crooks want to add another {$80.00} to our monthly payment.

The trick is that they use this tactic to get you to refinance your loan with them. They charge a bunch of fees and you loan amount increase even if your monthly payment is lowered. Immediately XXXX transferrred my loan to this crooked company they have been sending me foreclosure letters even though I owe them nothing also refinance letters and forms.They even went as far as sending someone to my house without any notice trying to force us to refinance our loan which at its Current form we are happy with. We are not looking to refinance our loan and this crooked company dont have any right to add another {$80.00} to our monthly payment.

7/16/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Dear Sir or Madam, We have a conventional thirty year fixed mortgage loan with Navy Federal Credit Union that closed approximately two years ago. We recently received a New Mortgage payment notice letter from Navy Federal stating that our monthly payment is going up thirteen percent effective immediately. This is the second mortgage increase that we received in last than two years. Our original payment we started out including taxes and escrow was {$2400.00} per month. And it has ballooned to over {$3100.00} per month on a thirty year conventional loan. In less than two years our monthly payment has risen a whooping thirty percent. This is predatory lending at its worse. This has placed a tremendous financial hardship on us, which places us in risk of making the new payment. Our closing documents stated that our payments should not increase more than the original monthly payment. We feel at a minimum this is a violation of Truth in Lending Act and RESPA and unethical mortgage practices that Navy Federal has exercised. When we were in the process of closing the loan the Navy Federal Loan broker XXXX XXXX stated that after the loan closes we are eligible for a one time no obligation interest rate modification if the rates drop since our interest rate was higher than the market at the time. The rates did drop and we contacted Navy Federal customer services numerous times to get a mortgage rate modification and the Customer Service department stated that we could not get the rate interest modification we were misled. The broker mislead us to sale the loan. Doing the closing process XXXX reiterated that we would have the rate modification option, since our rate was significantly higher that market rates. 

Overall this is a huge monthly increase of thirty percent since the close of the loan, in less than two years. This has placed a huge financial hardship and burden on us We need your assistance to bring our payment manageable and bring Navy Federal into regulatory compliance from numerous and egregious predatory lending practices on this loan. Thanks for your attention in this matter.

Defendant used deceptive debt collection practices to attempt to create a contract by way of payment stated on their letter head We are a debt collector. This communication is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used that purpose. However, to the extent your original obligation was discharged or is subject to an automatic stay of bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code, this notice is for compliance with non-bankruptcy law and/or informational purposes only and does not constitute an attempt to collect a debt or to impose personal liability for such obligation. Nothing in this letter ( including our use of the words "" your, '' "" loan, '' mortgage, '' or "" account '' ) means that you 're required to repay a debt that 's been discharged. Any payment you make on the account is voluntary, but we may still have rights under the security instrument, including the right to foreclose on the property. 
lf you are represented by an attorney, please refer this letter to your attorney and provide us with the attorney 's name, address, and telephone number. 
This is deceptive due to the fact that many attempts where made on the behalf of the Plaintiffs to removed the debt with offer ( s ) to pay, accepted for value return for value aka discharge and a bond money order which was not rejected in writing nor in explanation with a legal notarized document with agent or officer signature explanation as to why or why not offers where not excepted within the legal bylaws UCC laws etc, .. 
Definition - Acceptance for Value is a remedy available only in commercial law ( the Uniform Commercial Code or UCC ). One can accept for value ONLY a commercial instrument that has been issued for value, that is when 1. ) the instrument has been issued to generate value where there is NO prior value ; AND when 2. ) the instrument ( such as a bill or a charge ) has NO signed contract to back it up. 
In short, an instrument issued for value is an OFFER TO CONTRACT from someone ( the ISSUER ), unbacked by a pre-existing, written contract, in which that person is attempting to get YOU to give value to that instrument by having you falsely believe that you owe money when you, in fact, owe nothing. HOW you respond, determines whether YOU or the ISSUER becomes liable for the amount claimed. If you ignore the offer ( and therefore dishonor the person making the offer ) or give it a blank endorsement ( with your signature only ), you have assumed liability for the amount specified. However, if you give the instrument a qualified endorsement or conditional acceptance ( by accepting it for value ), you have, in fact, made a counteroffer, and kept yourself in honor by responding to the original offer, and thereby kept the liability on the ISSUER. In the case of a bill sent to you, your qualified endorsement via accepted for value keeps the ISSUER liable for the money claimed NOT you! You retain your status as the creditor in the situation, and it is up to YOU whether that instrument ( the bill or charge you received ) becomes a negotiable instrument ( money ) with which you can settle the account. You can either accept for value, placing all liability for payment on the original issuer ; OR you can accept for value and then specify that the money will be paid using the money created by your government bond created by your Birth Certificate under the emergency laws enacted following the bankruptcy of the U.S. in 1933. ( Note : In the bankruptcy of 1933 the U.S. government took ownership of all land and possessions of the American people, including the people themselves as surety for further loans from the Federal Reserve and the international bankers. Under the legal TRUST created by the U.S. Constitution, such a taking action would have been outright theft and fraud, so the government was required to offer a remedy to the people, as the beneficiaries of that TRUST, in order to exercise their rights, if they so choose. ) Since the issuer had NO signed, written contract to back his claim, he was forced to issue for value ( i.e., issue it in an attempt to create value ) his instrument ( whether a bill, legal indictment, traffic ticket or other violation of a statute, any demand for payment, or whatever ). In essence, the issuer is throwing you a hot potato and is hoping you will be ignorant enough to simply accept the instrument as a contract offer as it is ; and give it value by ignoring it or by your blank endorsement ; and to thereby accept the liability for paying it. If you accept it for value and return it for value, you have tossed him back the hot potato in the form of a counteroffer, so that he ( the issuer ) becomes liable for the amount of money specified in his original instruments claim, unbacked by any pre-existing contract. 
Consequently, the instrument issued pays the instrument! The original issuer pays the original issue he pays himself. Therefore, the transaction is balanced to zero and closed. 
Of note : In ALL penal actions for violations of STATUTES, the national debt is the PRESUMED preexisting contract, for purchase, that influences the conscience of the judge in making his decisions. Since under the Laws of XXXX and the Natural Law ( derived from XXXX Law ), ALL men are equal in authority. Therefore, no man or body of men can legitimately coerce or force another man to do something against his wishes and will! Consequently, under the Common Law, and international commercial law, NO man can be forced into a contract against his wishes, AND there must be equal consideration ( things of equal VALUE ) exchanged between the parties, with full disclosure of information, in order for a contract to be valid. It appears that today, few Americans realize that under long-standing international law, ALL legislated STATUTES or ACTS by any legislative body are mere OFFERS TO CONTRACT, which any individual man has the right to accept or refuse, as he wishes. One must remember that since 1933, ALL statutes ( legislated laws ) in the U.S. exist to pay back the national debt of the U.S. to the Federal Reserve banks and other U.S. creditors and they want you to agree and consent to be liable for this debt! Therefore, if a district attorney issues an information ( similar to an indictment, but not requiring a grand jury ) to you charging you with a crime, you have three choices regarding his offer to contract. First, you can IGNORE it, in which case you are in dishonor and assume liability for payment in either money or service in prison to repay the national debt. Second, you can SIGN it without conditions ( called an unqualified endorsement or blank endorsement ), then you have created a negotiable instrument by giving it value and have assumed liability for paying it, which can then be enforced by the issuer ( the district attorney as the government ) to help pay off the national debt. OR third, you can sign the information with a qualified endorsement using accept for value ( a counteroffer ), by which you give that instrument a monetary value, but keep the liability for paying it on the ISSUER. So, in the case of legal charges against you by a district attorney or a court clerk ( usually by a traffic ticket issued by a police officer ), through an accept for value endorsement you have avoided all liability ; and kept the liability for payment ( as money and/or a prison sentence ) on the district attorney and/or court clerk it is then, THEY who need to pay the fine or fulfill the imposed prison sentence for that statute violation ; NOT you, since you did not accept liability. They tossed a hot potato to you and expected you to pay. But since they had NO signed, written contract in which you agreed to obey that particular statute, they were required under U.C.C. commercial law to issue that document for value that is, to issue it in the hope that YOU would give it value AND take liability for paying it by accepting it without any qualifications. However, by your accept for value qualified endorsement, you agreed to it and gave it its value, but declined to accept liability for payment. Then by returning the instrument ( the charges against you ), you tossed the hot potato back to them and kept THEM liable for any payments! This system may sound INSANE, but this is how the financial and legal system was set up following the 1933 bankruptcy of the U.S., along with the amended extensions of national emergency of 1917 and 1933. When you go to court, you go to a legislative-statutory court in essence, a Maritime-Admiralty court operating under the UCC bankruptcy code whose sole purpose is to fund the national debt NOT into a true judicial court. You are PRESUMED guilty and are subject to a summary judgment without any trial by jury, unless you simultaneously convene your OWN court-of-record under the Common Law within that courtroom. And that system is still in effect today within the U.S.

9/14/2015,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"This message is a follow up to complaint # XXXX with the intent of modifying the "" desired resolution ''. To recap the issue, my wife and I applied for a construction loan with BB & T bank in North Carolina. We spoke with the mortgage loan officer on XX/XX/2015, clarified our need for a construction loan for XXXX the cost of construction. We submitted all documents on XX/XX/XXXX requested from BB & T in their letter of XX/XX/2015. We were told by our loan officer that the loan would be processed in one week. I stated clearly that if there was any chance that the loan would not be approved, I did not want to go through with the appraisal at a cost of {$430.00}. I was assured that if the appraisal was ordered, our loan would be approved. 

There was not one representation made by BB & T that held true. They lied about the appraisal, they lied about the passive income limits from our retirement accounts, they lied about the loan to value ratio requirements, they lied about not having received documentation from us, and they lied about closing dates. 

We continued to be strung along by this group of unprofessionals for XXXX months with excuses about the underwriters and the loan processors "" not communicating ''. We then reached our planned spending limit of XXXX the construction cost from our savings with new promises of closing on XXXX XXXX, 2015. XXXX days after being told the closing needed rescheduling, we were told that due to time limits on documentation, we would need to resubmit financial statements. This tactic occurred XXXX times. 

My wife and I finally decided to drop our efforts to close the loan one day after filing our previous complaint to this agency. That day, I spoke with XXXX XXXX, XXXX Manager, and had the same false assurances repeated that had been made by XXXX of her XXXX underlings. Once again we were told that financial documents previously submitted to the bank, would need to be submitted. At this point I realized that our efforts were in vain. 

I have been in and around the construction industry for XXXX years and have worked with at least XXXX other financial institutions with construction loans for projects/homes I have constructed ( all successfully ) and I have never seen anything like the incompetence and outright misrepresentation of the truth as exhibited by the entire chain of command at BB & T.

7/29/2017,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I am writing to request correction of the errors described below regarding the mortgage on our property. Background information : On XX/XX/XXXX, we contacted Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to fill out an application for a Modification. We spoke with the Home Preservation Specialist # 1, who worked with us throughout the start of this process. She worked with us from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, until we were informed our new Preservation Specialist # 2. 1. During the process with Specialist # 1 we were told we did not qualify for the Modification, but would be considered for a Deferral Agreement. She informed us that to qualify, we would have to make 3 consecutive monthly payments of {$1500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, which we did. Following she would inform us of the new payment amount until the processing of the signed paperwork for the Deferral is completed. 2. Upon calling Specialist # 1 on XX/XX/XXXX about the Deferral Agreement letter we received, which stated our next payment is due in XX/XX/XXXX, she confirmed the letter and said hereafter our payments would be due on the XXXX of each month. She further stated she would provide the amount to be paid until the paperwork was finalized with the underwriter. Specialist # 1 inform us to skip XX/XX/XXXX payment and to make the next payment of {$960.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This payment was also paid. 3. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received another Deferral Agreement, which Specialist # 1 said had to be sign because the first one was wrong. This agreement stated our next payment was XX/XX/XXXX. We called and left a message but was unable to contact her for the payment amount to be made. 4. On XX/XX/XXXX we call to make our monthly payment and was transferred to Specialist # 2, who after conversation told us our payment of {$910.00} was past due on XX/XX/XXXX. We explained we were told to make payments by the XXXX each month. She restated that it was due on XX/XX/XXXX. We made the payment of {$910.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. We explained we had received a statement in the mail saying the new monthly payment amount would be {$810.00}. She stated it was {$910.00} was due on the XXXX of each month until the paperwork was completed and signed off by her. We were also told not to speak with customer service, because they would not know the details because they do not have accesses to Home Preservation files. 5. As instructed, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX we called Specialist # 2 and made the payment of XXXX XXXX 6. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a Congratulatory Letter from Wells Fargo stating we have completed the payment assistance process, and Confirmation of Preferred Payment Plan enrollment stating our first electronic withdrawal would be on XX/XX/XXXX for {$810.00}, and continue each month thereafter on the same day, a monthly mortgage payment would be withdrawn. Simultaneously, we received another monthly statement that stated our payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX for {$810.00}. It also stated we had a past due balance of {$1600.00}. This was a red flag, and is where the confusion began. 7. We immediately called XXXX . Specialist # 2 to assess what was our actual payment and date, but a message stated she would be out of the office until XX/XX/XXXX. We were told to speak with another Preservation Specialist. We dialed back in and spoke to another preservation specialist who could not help because she was saying out payment due was {$1800.00}. 8. As well, we asked why did the account have a balance? She researched and stated we did make a XX/XX/XXXX payment. We explained we were told by Specialist # 1 our next payment was due XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX. 9. We also wanted to know if we should continue making the payment with Specialist # 2 for {$910.00} or the new payment of {$810.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, or should we wait for the automatic withdrawal on XX/XX/XXXX. 10. After trying to explain to her what we were told to pay and her trying to assist, she was unsuccessful and decided to transfer us to a supervisor ; however, after waiting for about 15 minutes, a supervisor was not available. She then transferred us to someone in Executive Offices. We left a message explaining our situation and requesting a call back. 11. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called back. He stated we were at the highest level and would assist us. We explained our situation trying to finalize if we should make the payment with him because Specialist # 2 was on vacation or should we wait for the automatic withdrawal on XX/XX/XXXX. A. ) He told us to wait for the automatic withdrawal. B ). He took our statement to research why we were told not to make a payment in XX/XX/XXXX, and C ). He stated he would research our concern of the outstanding past due. We also explained this had affected our credit scores negatively because it was reported we were late since XX/XX/XXXX. 12. He promised to research this and get back to us in 5-10 business days. We called him again on XX/XX/XXXX to see if we should go ahead and make our XX/XX/XXXX payment which was due, because it had not been withdrawn for our account. He returned the call and stated he was still working on our case and not to make the payment that it would be taken out soon. On XX/XX/XXXX, he called and stated not to make the payment, and to inform us that we are on a bi-weekly payment in the amount of {$810.00}. He also stated that we have a back balance for XX/XX/XXXX and for XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3200.00}. We stated our concerns about our affected negative credit scores, the Preservation Specialists statement and the letter we received stating our payments were monthly not bi-weekly, and that we did not understand nor have {$3200.00} to pay. We followed the instructions given and paid what we were told to complete the trial period and the payments amounts we were told we had to pay. We said we have the monthly payment of {$910.00} or {$810.00} which we were told to pay. He said he was still researching it and would remove all the late fees, and had requested from the credit company that our mortgage be suppressed until everything was cleared up. He said the suppression would take affect within 90 days and if there was still negative credit reporting following that time, we were to contact him and he would have it removed. 13. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called again to say our payments of {$810.00} were bi-weekly and we have a balance of {$3200.00}. He said while he was still investigating our case, we should consider making payment because it would not be deducted for our bank account. We explained that we do not have that amount of money. We have the monthly payment of {$910.00} or {$810.00} which we were told to pay in our possession. He stated that the account would be in foreclosure after 90 days. We told him the Congratulatory Letter stated that our new payment is {$810.00} monthly. He stated the letter was a mistake. We asked what happened to finding out why we were told not to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment. He said he was still researching it and would call us back on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 14. On XX/XX/XXXX, we made the XX/XX/XXXX monthly payment of {$810.00} although we were told not to because we dont want it to be considered a late payment. Please help us resolve these issues : We can not make a {$3200.00} payment, and we can not afford a bi-monthly payment of {$910.00} or {$810.00}. This is close to what we were paying when we requested the modification, because we were behind in our mortgage. We would like an accurate account of our actual monthly payments and the actual payment date so we can keep our home for our family. We would like Wells Fargo to retract the negative credit reporting, which dropped our credit scores. We would like to know why were we given an escrow assessment and new monthly payment plan of {$810.00}. Why were we given an escrow refund of {$260.00} in XX/XX/XXXX if we owed Wells Fargo {$3200.00}? Why were we told by the Preservation Specialist, Specialist # 1 not to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment, which Wells Fargo Mortgage now says we owe and has negatively affected our credit reports? Why did XXXX XXXX say the Congratulatory letter and Confirmation of Preferred Payment Plan letter we received were a mistake?

3/29/2016,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"I took out XXXX loans in XXXX and XXXX to supplement my federal loans. The total was {$8100.00}. My Dad helped me out and paid the set payment fee for two years ; this was approximately {$80.00} a month split between the XXXX loans. The interest rate has constantly changes around XXXX depending on which loan. It has now been 10 years and I have barely made a dent on the loan. As of XXXX XXXX I was told I would have XXXX more months of repayments-14.5 more years at {$65.00} a month. I am not the best at math but with an interest rate at 4 % I would have {$230.00} in interest a year, {$19.00} a month and yet, when I have been paying {$100.00} a month ( recently ) only {$43.00} knocked off the balance. Where does the other {$57.00} go to? 29.6 % interest? As of XXXX XXXX they started combining the loan information onto XXXX statement. Then I noticed that my payment statement shows the {$100.00} payments but that only {$55.00} has been applied each month. I do n't know where the rest of the money is going to. When you call AES you get mysterious hang ups/long wait hold times over an hour, etc. A person is given the run around. my loan balance is {$5700.00} from {$8100.00} in 10 years of payments! That was {$7200.00} ( at least because multiple payments over the monthly payment due ) in that time period. If my calculations are correct, interest at 4 % on the principal balance to start would have been {$320.00} a year which of course decreases with payments. Even with that, that would be {$3200.00} in interest over 10 years meaning I have paid ( at least ) {$3900.00} off on my loan. Yet, according to my statement I have only paid off {$2300.00}. Please help, I am doing all I can to be responsible but this is disheartening on top of the federal loans I have to shoulder.

She then said do you have any other credit cards that you owe money on. I said yes I do owe a small fee of a few hundred dollars on a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card. 
I asked her again I said are you saying I have to pay no interest on this card with Citizens bank for the first year she said again XXXX I am XXXX telling you the truth this lady XXXX XXXX said no its our promotion and its for the one year no interest at all on the card. Even on purchases she said although there maybe a small fee to transfer the funds over to this account I said ok let me think about this and call my bank so I did and I told my bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX and explained to them about this offer and to not cause any problems I said Citizens bank is running a promotion for one year on all transactions with 0 % interest and I would like to take this offer. They said watch out there is most likely a fee to transfer the funds over to them. I said they said it would be a small fee.

I said ok are you sure there are no fees for a year she again said yes no fees although again she said get what you have to with our card and make sure you pay it off within a year and then cancel it is exactly what she said.

10/11/2018,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Complaint XXXX about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. to remove their account from my Credit report/ I received credit reports from XXXX and from Experian monthly. 
This is regarding Credit Report # XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX from EXPERIAN. 
On page 8 of 12, of the report, there is an information entry by XXXX/XXXX XXXX, Partial account XXXX ... .. 

I opened this XXXX XXXX account in XX/XX/XXXX to my best memory and XXXX Credit Report XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX ( EXPERIAN ). 
I opened this account because I had a medical emergency dental procedure, a XXXX actually, at the XXXX XXXX, in Washington DC, XXXX XXXX XXXX.I run out of money, and Doctors office offered to me to open an account with XXXX XXXX in Florida. The APR INterest rate to my best memory was very high about 30 % or more. 
But I needed to pay for doctors and I accepted the offer and applied and received XXXX XXXX card with high interest rate ( to pay for my MEDICAL BILL ). 

However, I do remember when I was driving from my storage in XXXX, VA, and stopped at the XXXX XXXX, VA, on parking lot, and made my last payment to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I also told to the XXXX XXXX that I want to close this account. ANd this is it, I can not afford no more to have no credit cards. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I placed my condo in D.C. for sale. The Recession started in XX/XX/XXXX. My house, my home, condo, could not sell. It went to SHORT SALE, because value dropped from {$640000.00} to {$300.00} XXXX ... and I was in HORROR what is happening. 

I also lost all my money and job. XXXX XXXX filed for a FORECLOSURE on my home, But I filed for Bankruptcy Chapter XXXX with attorney XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Attorney XXXX reported all my credit cards in the bankruptcy, But XXXX XXXX was not reported to be included in the bankruptcy Chapter XXXX to stop foreclosure. I do remember that I PAID it off, and I closed it in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Moving forward : Fast forward. 
Yesterday I received Experian report, I checked again all the entries. I saw an entry by XXXX XXXX XXXX Partial account number XXXX XXXX XXXX ... 
I see this account all the time. And i called to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX - about to remove this entry because it is in GOOD standing but hanging there ... for no reason. 
I did not understand that GOOD CREDIT will be in my credit report for 10 years. 

So when I rec. credit repXXXX from Experian yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called today again in SYNCB/CARE CREDIT at # XXXX to check the status of XXXX to stop report this "" good '' credit to credit reports companies? I called XXXX spoke with XXXX. XXXX asked for my Social Security Number, because I dont have account number no more.

I gave it to her ( SSAN ), and date of birth, and address in Washington DC and phone number. EVE found something about me. She said that she must transfer me to another department.I asked her ; what is the name of another department? She said it is BANKRUPTCY DEPARTMENT. I said to EVEn that this account was never been included in BANKRUPTCY and it was paid in full by me in XX/XX/XXXX! ( UNLESS TRUSTEE for the bankruptcy decided to include this paid off account in the bankruptcy in order to increase the volume of the bankruptcy accounts. But in XXXX when I called to XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was told that it is Good account, in good ending, and will fell off in XX/XX/XXXX.I was not told in XX/XX/XXXX that my account is in BAD standing in BANKRUPTCY and this is why it will be on the record FOREVER!!! ) It is my understanding that BAD accounts will be on the Credit Report for 7 years. And Good accounts will be on the Credit Report for 10 years. And this was told to me in XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX agent, she told me that this account is GOOD ending account and will be removed in XX/XX/XXXX after 10 years of GOOD credit reporting. BUT today I suddenly found out that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who offered and gave me this card with 30 or 33 % RATE, in XX/XX/XXXX, -- moved this my record in BANKRUPTCY DEPARTMENT!!!!! 
I was in bankruptcy CHAPTER XXXX to Stop FORECLOSURE, fighting for my HOME and existence for 5 years!!! -- and it was painful. It all flash backed to me again today. 
THUS, EVE of XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX told me that I must call to BANKRUPTCY Department to collect DEBT, amd that my account is a BANKRUPTCy account to collect debt ( my XX/XX/XXXX card XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX medical cards. ) # XXXX, XXXX could not transfer me internally to BANKRUPTCY department.I called XXXX, ext, # XXXX, Ext # XXXX ( all others ). 

I spoke with XXXX Agent Employee ID # XXXX at ca. XXXX XXXX. ( approx ) Steve Employee ID # XXXX asked and received again my Social Security number, Date of Birth, Tel Number, last 4 XXXX, and address where I live now.I told to XXXX that I opened that card in XX/XX/XXXX. I closed it in XX/XX/XXXX. The highest was {$250.00}. And it was paid off and closed IT was medical expense. It was NOT included in bankruptcy Chapter XXXX to stop foreclosure. He could not locate my account. He said that I must speak with another department. XXXX said that my account is in INTERNAL DEPARTMENT of XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX said that he can not do anything and he transferred me to number XXXX, INTERNAL DEPARTMENT. ( I dont understand what it means ). 

I called to XXXX, spoke with XXXX of XXXX/XXXX XXXX Internal department at XXXX XXXX. ( approx ). 
XXXX asked me for last four of SSN, DOB, PHONE # ( I remembered that in XX/XX/XXXX I maybe had number XXXX. Maybe not. But I gave it to her, in addition to current phone number which ends with XXXX. ) XXXX could not locate me nor my account. 
I asked her to explain to me why my account is declared by XXXX XXXX as bankruptcy account to collect debt? and if it is so, then it should be on the credit report for 7 years not for 10 years. She did not answer. I asked her to remove please this account which they keep on my credit report as BAD account and overtime- 3 years overtime, if they consider it a BAD debt collection account what it is not! 
She did not answer. After a while second later, i called her name XXXX, XXXX, she did not answer. To my best understanding the phone dropped died, and i was talking to myself. 
This is why I am upset about what is happening : if it is account in bad standing, then there are time limitation for this account to be on the record ( credit rep ). 
But it was NOT in Bankruptcy yet I was treated like a criminal -- for asking to remove this record from my credit report because they told me that it is a BANKRUPTCy Account and then I called to 1. XXXX, 2. XXXX, 3 XXXX. 

For your information : In ca. XX/XX/XXXX, my old XXXX XXXX needed a new Transmission.  And XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. in DMV area, had a XXXX XXXX offer for a credit card for to repair transmission. I applied in XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX XXXX  for new Transmission.I was approved by XXXX XXXX for a credit in amount of {$500.00}. Attached is a copy of the card. I never used the credit card for TRANSMISSION repair, because i bought a new car under WARRANTY of Manufacturer. AndI closed XXXX XXXX account credit card in XX/XX/XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I never used it and I closed it. IF I was so much on the BAD LIST of the XXXX XXXX -- that XXXX  and XXXX and XXXX referred me to Bankruptcy Internal Bad credit department -- then why XXXX XXXX  offered to me a new credit card in 2018 and gave me credit {$500.00}?

I admittedly fell behind on my bill back in XXXX as I could not find work after retiring from the military after 21 years of service. AAFES began to garnish my military retiree annuity to pay the bill in XXXX. Garnishments were taken in XXXX and XXXX then they stopped. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from AAFES advising me that the garnishment would start, and specifically states "" the amount of the indebtedness is {$11000.00}.

AAFES directed me to contact "" XXXX '' their debt collection agency. I have never been informed in writing that AAFES has secured their services to collect the debt. Additionally, I am unsure of what role XXXX is playing as AAFES has the order in to garnish my retiree pay and AAFES has been garnishing my income tax returns, not XXXX.

So, I asked him if he could help with the refinancing, and he said yes.

So, I provided all required documents and paid the appraisal and mortgage fees. 
After paying the fees, the appraisal was done and my house value came back ok. 
To my surprise, XXXX XXXX told me the financing could not be finalized until I move back to my house. He stated that I told him I was going to move into my house before the refinancing is concluded. There was never a time I told XXXX XXXX this.

10/30/2018,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was paid,"The original balance on this account ( XXXX ) when I was laid off from my job was {$4400.00}. I have paid this amount plus any additional interest and late fees once I went back to work. The account went into collections in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX which then became XXXX XXXX. I continued to pay on the account ; however I never received an actual statement from XXXX  listing payments received, interest, etc., I only received an email telling me the payment was due and the balance. The last 'statement ' I received from XXXX was on XX/XX/XXXX and the balance was {$770.00}. I could not find a way to contact anyone to pay the balance in full ( no valid phone number, address, email address on the emailed "" statement '' ) eventually a representative called me when the payment was late. I arrange a phone payment with the representative for {$360.00}, the representative agreed to remove the late fees and I promised to pay the remaining {$360.00} in XXXX, XXXX which I did. XXXX then sold the account with a balance of {$640.00} to Portfolio Recovery Associates. When they called me, I told them that the account was paid and a mistake was made but they insisted it was valid. I looked the company up online thinking that this was some kind of a scam, here is a link to what I found https : //www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/portfolio-recovery-associates-llc.html They continued to call me for the money, I believed it was a scam. I sent a letter to them in writing and via email that they were not to call me at work or on my cell phone but they continued to call. I ignored their letters and phone calls ( I did log them ) and now I am getting a letter from an attorneys office, XXXX XXXX XXXX threatening a judgement against me. Portfolio Recovery Associates also reported the debt to the credit bureaus, lowing my credit score that I worked really hard to bring back up and I am now being denied financing that I need for a new roof on my home! I have sent them a letter ( via regular and certified mail ) with the last statement, a copy of the funds sent from my bank, a phone log of all the harassing phone calls, a request that they acknowledge payment was made in full and that they correct the payment history information provided to the credit bureau.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,OH,447XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/30/2018,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3061080
